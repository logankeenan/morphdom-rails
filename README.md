# Morphdom Rails

This repo is just for playing around with [morphdom](https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom) which is the backing dom diff'ing framework used in [Pheonix Live View](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view).


I wanted to test out how well Morphdom would work by show search results as a user types in a search box.
